Cygwin Windows Explorer integration: Known errors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Some file names and paths for both the shell scripts and objects that are
   being dropped onto them are not supported, for instance if they contain
   single quotes (').

 - Drag&drop support is limited to 8 items. If more than 8 items are being
   dropped onto a shell script file some of them will be omitted without any
   feasible way to find out which ones.
